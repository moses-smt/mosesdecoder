#This is somewhat hairy due to the number of optional language models.  
#Currently, the optional models are IRSTLM, SRILM, and RandLM.  These are
#activated by --with-irstlm, --with-srilm, and --with-randlm respectively.
#The value is the path where it's installed e.g. --with-irstlm=/path/to/irst.
#Each optional model has a section below.  The top level rule is lib LM, which
#appears after the optional models.  

import option path ;

#This is a kludge to force rebuilding if different --with options are passed. 
#Could have used features like <srilm>on but getting these to apply only to
#linking was ugly and it still didn't trigger an install (since the install
#path doesn't encode features).  It stores a file lm.log with the previous
#options and forces a rebuild if the current options differ.
