Building the RPM SPEC file
--------------------------

The first phase is to construct the RPM SPEC file in $HOME/rpmbuild. The build_source.sh script builds all the artefacts needed to build. This script needs the following information:

 - The Git repository from which an installer will be built,
 - The branch in the Git repository to build, and
 - The version of the installed Moses distribution.

For example, to build the RELEASE-1.0 branch in the mosesdecode repository (git://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder.git):

$ build_source.sh -r git://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder.git -b RELASE-1.0 -v 1.0

This builds the source tarballs in the $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES directory and the moses.spec file in $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS.


Building the RPM
----------------

Change directory to $HOME/rpmbuild, and build the binary RPM with:

$ rpmbuild -bb SPECS/moses.spec

This will download IRSTLM v5.70.04 and GIZA++ v2, then build them along with Moses and make the RPM in the directory $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/<architecture>/moses-<version>-1.<architecture>.rpm.

For example building on a 64 bit Intel architecture, and building v1.0 the RPM would be called moses-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm.


Building a Debian package
-------------------------

The Alien tool converts RPM packages to Debian packages. If a Debian package is required then follow the instructions on the following web-page:
