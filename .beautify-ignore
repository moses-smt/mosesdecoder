# Files and directories that beautify.py should not clean up.
#
# This file is not as advanced as, say, .gitignore.  It only supports files
# and directory paths relative to the project root, one per line, no globs,
# no quotes.
#
# Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from filenames, but internal
# whitespace is preserved.
#
# Lines starting with a hash mark, such as this one, are comments.  The hash
# mark must be the first character on the line.  Blank lines are ignored.
#
# The .beautify-ignore file must be encoded in UTF-8.
